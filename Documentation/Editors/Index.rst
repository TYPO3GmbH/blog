Add content to your post
-------------------------

11. Add content elements to your blog post page

.. note::

   You can add all kinds of content elements that you are using on the rest of your web site, too. The blog itself doesn't
   provide any special elements for the content of your blog entry as sticking close to the rest of your website ensures a
   consistent look and feel for your visitors.
