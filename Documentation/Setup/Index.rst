Setup Wizard
------------

The Setup Wizard creates a fully configured **standalone** instance of the TYPO3 
Blog Extension. If you already have an existing site, you might dislike the result
of having an additional and unplanned root page. In that case, please read the 
manual setup instructions.

Manual Setup
------------

The manual setup helps you to build an **integrated** instance of the TYPO3 Blog 
Extension. If you want a standalone Blog and do not have an existing
site, please go with the Setup Wizard instructions.
