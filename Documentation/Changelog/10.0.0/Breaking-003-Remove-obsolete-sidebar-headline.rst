Breaking: Remove obsolete sidebar headline
==========================================

Description
===========

The sidebar headline does not deliver any benefit. The user has the option
to use the title of the content element to add a headline to the sidebar if
necessary, in general this has no real use case since only the headlines
of the widgets are relevant.
