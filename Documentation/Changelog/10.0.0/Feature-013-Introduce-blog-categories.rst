==================================
Feature: Introduce blog categories
==================================

Description
===========

The behavior of blog categories is now streamlined with categories that can be
selected within the page records. Without touching or limiting normal categories.
Blog categories only show other blog categories within the parent selector box,
that are created in the same directory. Note: SEO content is only available for
blog categories, not (anymore) for default categories.
